ANSWERS TO QUESTION 1,2,3
Q1: 
Primary Differences Between TensorFlow and PyTorch
TensorFlow and PyTorch are both powerful deep learning frameworks, but they differ in how they handle computation graphs. TensorFlow uses a static computation graph, which means the model structure is defined first and executed later. This makes it highly efficient for deployment but less intuitive for beginners. PyTorch, on the other hand, uses a dynamic computation graph, meaning the model structure is built on-the-fly during execution. This allows for easier debugging and a more Pythonic coding style, making it popular in academic research.
You might choose TensorFlow when you're building large-scale, production-ready systems—especially if you need mobile or embedded device support. PyTorch is a better choice when you're experimenting, doing research, or building models that require flexibility.
Q2: 
Two Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI Development
First, Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for exploratory data analysis. Developers can load datasets, clean them, visualize trends, and test ideas quickly. The combination of code cells and visual outputs makes it easy to experiment and understand the data.
Second, Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for model prototyping. You can train and evaluate machine learning or deep learning models in a step-by-step format, while documenting your process with Markdown. This makes collaboration and revision much easier during development.
Q3:
How spaCy Enhances NLP Compared to Basic Python String Operations
spaCy offers far more advanced natural language processing capabilities than basic Python string functions. While simple operations like .split() or .replace() only handle raw text, spaCy understands the structure of language. It can tokenize text intelligently, identify named entities such as people or places, tag words with their parts of speech, and parse sentence grammar. This makes spaCy much more powerful and accurate for tasks like text analysis, chatbot development, or document classification.
2. Comparative Analysis{ANSWERS}
Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs. TensorFlow
Scikit-learn is best suited for traditional machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. It's very beginner-friendly, with a simple and consistent API that makes it easy to try different models. TensorFlow, in contrast, is designed for deep learning and neural network development. It can handle more complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and large-scale training.
In terms of ease of use, Scikit-learn is generally easier for newcomers, while TensorFlow can be more complex—though its high-level API, Keras, has improved usability. Both have strong community support, but TensorFlow has a broader ecosystem for deployment and scalability.
